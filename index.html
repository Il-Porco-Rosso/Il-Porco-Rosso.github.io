        THIEF DELIVERY

ACT I
SCENE I (INTRO)

(The stage is set into 3 sections; an office/shop (a single cubicle), a bench on the street, and a roofed area (like a bus stop but not))
(At the roofed area there is a table with two randos eating noodles)
(Morris' BOSS is sitting in the office, BOSS’S SERVANT is standing right outside, MORRIS enters.)

SERVANT: Inside.

MORRIS: Hello Sir-

SERVANT: Inside. Boss has something to say.

(SERVANT points inside)

MORRIS: Ok, but I have a question for-

SERVANT: Inside. Go.

MORRIS: Ok. 

(MORRIS goes inside)
         
BOSS: Hello Morris.

MORRIS: Hello.

BOSS: Would you so kindly care to explain why you haven't been getting your work done lately?

MORRIS: Huh? Well sir, I have but-

BOSS: You see, here at Orange Co. we strive for innovation and quality, something you simply haven't been giving us.

MORRIS: But sir, I finished, there's just been a glitch with-

BOSS: I have been looking at my lists and they show that all of your coworkers have been turning in work except for you. As someone in our sales department, you should be able to manage the workload.

MORRIS: Sir. I have done the work, there has just been a glitch that delays-

BOSS: No, no! I do not want to hear it. If you cannot get your work to me, you can't stay here. That is a simple fact, now get out. GET OUT!

(MORRIS exits the cubical towards center stage)

SERVANT: Sorry. Boss is very particular about his company.  

 (MORRIS overhears his BOSS)

BOSS: Heheh, what a loser. Now for something much more important! Heheheh.

(BOSS gets a box of pastries (or a pie) and starts wolfing it down, making a mess)

 SERVANT: I wish you the best of luck.

(SERVANT helps BOSS with his pie, MORRIS sits down on the bench)

MORRIS: *sigh*

(JEAN enters)

JEAN: Oh, hey!

MORRIS: Hey, Jean.

(JEAN sits next to MORRIS and offers a cigarette)

JEAN: Rough day, eh?

MORRIS: …Yeah. 

JEAN: Oh? What happened?

MORRIS: I got fired. The papers I sent him were delayed by a few days. You know, server stuff, but he just thought I was getting lazy.

JEAN: Dang.

MORRIS: Yeah. It sucks. 

JEAN: …Well, look on the bright side! Now you only have to worry about missing dinner.

MORRIS: … You know what? You’re right, let's get something to eat.

JEAN: Know any good places?

MORRIS: Yeah, have you been to the ramen shop around the corner here?

JEAN: Oh, that one?

MORRIS: Yeah, the one owned by Kawasaki.

JEAN: Yeah I’ve been there! Amazing.

MORRIS: Agreed.

(MORRIS and JEAN make their way towards the doorway/roofed area)

 MORRIS: Have you found a job yet?

JEAN: Well, I have my own little business now. If you can call it that, I sell random stuff to people that I stole from this poor guy’s truck.

(A WAITER greets the two when they’re at the roofed area)

WAITER: For how many?

JEAN: Table for two.

WAITER: Give us five minutes, we’ll be with you soon!

JEAN: Thank you.

(WAITER exits)

MORRIS: You are selling random stuff that you stole from someone's truck.

JEAN: Well, I didn't steal it for myself.

MORRIS: Well, of course not, you instead take the stuff and use it to scam people.

JEAN: No I don't! I sell the stuff at reduced prices! or just at the normal price. The thing is, because there’s no extra cost, I make a lot. So, uhh.. if.. I mean-

MORRIS: Just get to the point.

JEAN: I can hire you! You need money right?

MORRIS: No, I don't want to be involved, and don't try to rub it in either.

JEAN: Then um… does… how about 45 dollars an hour.

MORRIS: 45 dollars an hour?!

JEAN: 45 dollars an hour.

MORRIS: Well…

(BOSS & SERVANT exit)

MORRIS: That's better than working at Orange Co. hmm… no.

JEAN: What? Why?

MORRIS: I don’t want to get involved.

JEAN: Don’t worry about it! Besides with another person, I’d say we would make way more!

MORRIS: Well,.. Ok,.. well, if-, other than burglary, what do you do?

JEAN: I deliver the stuff to people. 

MORRIS: *sigh*

(JEAN gets a notification on his phone)

JEAN: Here comes one now! 

MORRIS: What do they want?

JEAN: They want… two cans of sprite.

MORRIS: That’s it?

JEAN: Yup.

(JEAN gets another message)

JEAN: Wait, no, two barrels of spirits.

MORRIS: That’s more like it. I guess.

JEAN: …and a cherry coke.

MORRIS: *Sigh*

JEAN: Where am I going to fit two barrels of cheap whiskey?

MORRIS: I actually have a truck myself. I could lend it to you.                                                                                                             

JEAN: Sure, thanks… … … C’mon!

MORRIS: No.

JEAN: How about this, you drive the truck and deliver the stuff to people, I’ll get the stuff that you deliver. That way, you won't be part of it! If we get into some kind of scandal, I’ll say that you didn't know anything about it! Sound good?

MORRIS: …er

JEAN: How about 72 dollars an hour?

MORRIS: …m… sure.

JEAN: Yes!! … Ok, first order of business.

MORRIS: No.

JEAN: It’s something else!

MORRIS: Ok, what?

JEAN: My business, it needs a name. That's where.. you come in!

MORRIS: Why are you asking me for names? 

JEAN: Well, I just need help brainstorming. That's it.

MORRIS: Hmm.. Then let's just go with whatever comes off the top of my head. Burglar's Shipping Company?

JEAN: er… no. Doesn’t ring well.

MORRIS: Steal Canners?

JEAN: What? Not bold enough, give me something that sounds really shady.

MORRIS: Tik Tok.

JEAN: … … no, too shady. 

MORRIS: Then… What about… Hey wait, why are you trying to make it sound shady? 

JEAN: Mm… good point, then let's go with something cool.

MORRIS: Ok, something interesting then… how about…

(Roll starting credits, literally(a roll of paper with the basic credits is rolled out) Queue music)

(During this, a crowd goes on stage AND IN THE AUDIENCE. Some guys are causing trouble in random places, CRIMINAL 1 is onstage.)

CRIMINAL 1: Would you like some stolen Champagne!??

PERSON 1: Uhh… for how much?

(CRIMINALS 2 & 3 is threatening PERSON 2 with a broken bottle near the middle seats)

CRIMINAL 2: How dare you mess with the boss! 

CRIMINAL 3: Yeah! Don’t mess with BIG MAMA!

CRIMINAL 1: Just seven dollars!

PERSON 2: I’m sorry! I’m sorry!

(Someone right under the stage gets beat up by a thug)

PERSON 1: Yeah sure!

RANDOM THUG: Wait ‘till BIG MAMA hears about this! She’s the baddest of them all!

(Policemen approach CRIMINALS 2 & 3)

OFFICER 1: … … STOP BREAKING THE LAW!

CRIMINAL 3: Oh.. hi officer?

(the officers start to arrest CRIMINALS 2 & 3)

RANDO IN THE CROWD: BIG MAMA! HELP!

PERSON 1: Sir, I’m afraid you…

(PERSON 1 puts on a police hat and reveals he's a cop only for someone wearing a cute anime girl’s highschool uniform to burst into the theater. They (BIG MAMA) appear near one of the exits.)

ALL CRIMINALS WHO MENTIONED BIG MAMA : BIG MAMA!

CRIMINAL 2: Save us boss!

BIG MAMA: Haaaaaaai!

(BIG MAMA is arrested and taken out of the room.)

BIG MAMA: AAHH!!

PERSON 1: You’re under arrest for stealing a priceless bottle of Champagne!

(Some police officers dance their way towards CRIMINAL 1 and knock them out with one punch, he then gets arrested and thrown behind the curtains.)
(All the random brawls going on are stopped by policemen except for one lone thug in a corner of the theater(they come in later))

ROB: 你做咗咩呀? 

CRIMINAL 1: I treated you to dim sum once! Remember?!

ROB: What did you do?

CRIMINAL 1: I just thought I-

ROB: I know, you sold one of my guys stolen wine.

CRIMINAL 1: Please! Mercy! I won’t do it again!

ROB: Ok ok la. You’re a nice guy at heart. I don’t arrest good people. You can go.

(While the criminal is walking away, OFFICER ROB whispers to one of the other officers, they then beat the crap out of the criminal and arrest them.)
(Queue music, OFFICER ROB dances downstage and exits. Multiple policemen, some with stretchers, carry injured criminals across the stage.)
(officers double check the theater with flashlights in hand and find and take away the lone thug from before)
(More police walk across the stage, but now with cargo and loot, two officers carrie a secure safe with “ORANGES” written on it with a picture of an orange, four officers carry an antique closet)
(The officers place the loot up stage, center stage.)
(All officers exit. Music should have stopped by now)
(JEAN enters from the closet wearing a ninja costume)

JEAN: All clear.

(JEAN goes upstage to roll one barrel stageleft)
(MORRIS enters)

JEAN: Here it is, here’s one of them.

MORRIS: Thanks.

(JEAN rolls another barrel, MORRIS takes the barrel, exits and comes onstage again)

JEAN: Aaaand that's the last of it!

MORRIS: Phew!

(MORRIS takes the barrel offstage, JEAN looks downstage)

MORRIS: Let's get out of here so we don't run into trouble.

JEAN: Huh? No! We got more room right? Come help me out!

MORRIS: No we’ll get caught!

JEAN: Trust me bro.

(MORRIS and JEAN transport the box of oranges and other stuff onto the truck, they sit on the remaining items, JEAN offers a cigarette)

MORRIS: *Sigh* Ever wondered what cupped noodles tasted like fresh?

JEAN: Huh, no I don’t think I have. Actually, no. I made cupped noodles from scratch before.

MORRIS: Oh? How? 

JEAN: I made ramen noodles, then I took the cups to the freeze dryer down the street and gave it to them for a night. The broth is actually quite simple, I literally just boiled chick-

MORRIS: Shh…

(Someone shouts from behind the audience)

SOME RANDO: Hey! I think someone is over there!

JEAN: Lets book it.

(JEAN and MORRIS jump in the truck offstage and drive away, leaving a puddle of alcohol on the floor. Queue driving noises.)

(SOME RANDO and his coworkers enter the room from the back)

SOME RANDO: I swear I heard something.

(All walk towards the stage)

COWORKER 1: Are you sure you're not going crazy man?

SOME RANDO: Sure I’m sure.

COWORKER 2: Wait, check the street, what is that?

COWORKER 1: What?

(All climb up onstage)

COWORKER 2: Here, lemme help you up.

(COWORKER 2 helps up COWORKER 1)

COWORKER 2: See? That ain't no water.

(COWORKER kneels down, dips his pinky in the liquid and tastes it)

SOME RANDO: Man, you gotta stop doing that. One day you'll catch Ebola or something.

COWORKER 2: Ah! That's the taste of alcohol.

SOME RANDO: Why would there just be alcohol lying around?

COWORKER 2: Dunno man, dunno.

(Close curtains)

ACT I (still)

SCENE III

(Curtains stay Closed)
(A shopkeepers come into the audience near the stage)

RANDOM SHOPKEEPER 2: 蝦餃！燒賣！一蚊一碟！！

ORANGE SHOPKEEPER: Oranges! Sweet American oranges! 

(Customers all look at the orange stand.)

(In the cubical stage right, MORRIS & JEAN are delivering the stolen barrels to their CUSTOMER from a pile of their stolen cargo)

CUSTOMER: That's it? 

JEAN: Yeah.

(MORRIS places the barrels upright)

CUSTOMER: Didn’t we order something else too?

JEAN: I guess?

CUSTOMER: I can check. 

(CUSTOMER yells offstage)

CUSTOMER: Hey Robert! Didn’t we order something else?

(ROBERT enters)

ROBERT: What?

CUSTOMER: Didn’t we order something else?

ROBERT: Uhh.. A cherry coke.

JEAN: Oh right! Hey do we have a cherry coke?

MORRIS: Yeah we got one!

JEAN: Thanks!
 
CUSTOMER: That’ll be how much?

JEAN: Give me a second… 

(ROBERT notices the crate of oranges)

ROBERT: Hey, let's scrap the cherry coke. I’ll take that crate of oranges instead!

JEAN: Huh?

ROBERT: I want those oranges!

MORRIS: What do you need oranges for?

ROBERT: My buddy Jeff and I are going to sea on a yacht, and I bet we need some extra vitamin C! I’ll pay top dollar for your box there!

JEAN: Um.. OK, for how much are you willing to buy each orange for?

ROBERT: I’ll pay you top dollar.

JEAN: Sure, but give me a number.

ROBERT: 225 dollars.

CUSTOMER: Robert what are you doing?!

JEAN: It’s a lot of oranges, are you sure?

ROBERT: Then 250 dollars. Final offer.

JEAN: Uhhh… thanks?

ROBERT: I can pay for whatever amount! Don’t feel guilty. Plus, these are American oranges right? They must be worth a lot.

(ROBERT brings out his phone)

CUSTOMER: Robert! What are you DOING!?

ROBERT: See! The price of American oranges have skyrocketed!

CUSTOMER: Robert! No! What you’re thinking of is the Orange Co. public stocks! These are fruits! 

ROBERT: Shut up, you don't know anything about business.

JEAN:Ok, so, each crate has how many?

MORRIS: 200 oranges!

JEAN: 200 oranges. That’ll be… 50,000 dollars for the oranges, 55,650 dollars & 69 cents total. Just tap your card here.

(JEAN takes a card scanner from his pocket, ROBERT taps his phone on it)
(CUSTOMER slaps their forehead)

JEAN: That is all. Thank you!

ROBERT: No, thank YOU!

CUSTOMER: W- we’ll be off.

(ROBERT & CUSTOMER exit)
(MORRIS & JEAN pack up their cargo offstage.)

MORRIS: 50,000 dollars!?

JEAN: 50,000 dollars!!??

MORRIS: We’re rich!

JEAN: You can finally be a ramen chef!!

MORRIS: Woooo!! Yeah baby!

JEAN: We’re doing so well!!

(They calm down)

MORRIS: Let’s go get dim sum to celebrate! 

JEAN: Yeah yeah! Din Tai Fung?

MORRIS: Nah, let’s go to the Cantonese dim sum place that my friend owned.

JEAN: Wait, owned? They don’t own it anymore?

MORRIS: No, not anymore. They sold it.

JEAN: Ohhhhhh. They sold it.

MORRIS: Otherwise I would have gone there for employment.

JEAN: Good point, they still have good food though right?

MORRIS: Oh, don’t worry, the food hasn’t changed. If anything, it’s gotten better!

JEAN: Then what are we waiting for!

(JEAN & MORRIS pack up their cargo and exit)
(OFFICER ROB & INSPECTOR ZENIGATA enter stage right)

ROB: I guess you could say that!

ZENIGATA: Ever since I stopped chasing Lupin!

ROB: Ha!

(OFFICER ROB looks at the price of oranges in one of the shops)

ROB: When did people thought oranges were made of gold?
                         
ZENIGATA: Since new years.

ROB: Ha! But really, why do they cost so much now?

ZENIGATA: Well, some rich investors are panic buying oranges for that big yacht cruise. You've heard of it right?

ROB: Er, yes. The one around the world?

ZENIGATA: Yes, these investors have reportedly been paying more than 300 dollars per orange, apparently it has to do with "stocking up on vitamin C" and the oranges themselves are more valuable now. Remember that crate of oranges that your deputy confiscated the other day?

ROB: Yes, the box of american oranges. I was wondering why they would steal that of all things.

ZENIGATA: Yes, thieves have been taking advantage of the situation and have been raiding our ports.

ROB: The ports? What does that have to do with anything?

ZENIGATA: American oranges are imported every year across the world, each box has around 200 to 500 oranges according to the size. And because of them being foreign imports, sellers  can jack up the prices without being suspicious.

ROB: So all the oranges are in the ports. Huh.

ZENIGATA: Speaking of buying treats, do you want anything?

ROB: Yes, how about that!

(OFFICER ROB and INSPECTOR ZENGATA ask a shopkeeper for food)

ZENIGATA: Hello!

SHOPKEEP: Inspector Zen! How was your trip?

(Curtains start to close)

ZENIGATA: Oh, it was great!

(Curtains finish closing)
(Blackout)

ACT II

SCENE I

(The stage is set with many tables and chairs, all have people eating dim sum except for one table center stage)
(MORRIS, JEAN, and CHINESE WAITERS 1 and 2 enter, MORRIS is checking his phone)

(WAITER 1 points to the empty table)

(MORRIS and JEAN walk over and sit down)

MORRIS: It turns out…

JEAN: What?

MORRIS: Apparently, oranges, specifically American oranges, their prices have skyrocketed. Billionaires were panic buying them for a yacht cruise or something like that.

JEAN: What about it?

MORRIS: I’m pretty sure our last customer was one of those billionaires.

(JEAN starts to look at the menu, a few seconds pass)

MORRIS: Well, now I’m sort of trapped in this business.

JEAN: Heh heh, sorry about that.

MORRIS: I mean, it certainly pays the bills, so I’m not complaining about that.

JEAN: Yeah!

MORRIS: I have questions about the business side of things. Thief Delivery is a sketchy sounding business, I’m surprised nobody has questioned us about anything yet. 

JEAN: Oh yeah, forgot to tell you, but I made it so on paper, Thief Delivery is an orange selling business, and I also said that the “Thief” part is purely branding.

MORRIS: Ah, ok. I’m sure it’s not that simple, but I’ll take your word for it.

JEAN: Yeah, it wasn’t. It worked though! And that’s what matters.

MORRIS: Good point.

JEAN: You want to order?

 MORRIS: Sure, I actually took a Cantonese class not so long ago, so this shouldn’t be too bad.

JEAN: Maybe we go for the siu long bao? The soup dumplings?

MORRIS: Sounds good.

(WAITERS 1 & 2 approaches the table)

WAITER 2: 你好！

MORRIS: Nei hou! Ngo dei yew yi go siu long bao. (燒 *long* 包)

WAITER 1: … 好啊！

(The WAITERS leave the table and go stage left)

MORRIS: Nailed it.

WAITER 2: What did he say?

WAITER 1: I don’t know! I could barely understand him!

WAITER 2: Well, what could you hear from that?

WAITER 1: Uhh… It was like, “Nei hou! Ngo dei yew yi go siu long bao.”

WAITER 2: Yi.. go.. siu long bao? Why…?

WAITER 1: It’s probably best not to question their order.

WAITER 2: You’re right.

(The WAITERS exit)

JEAN: So, who’s next? The grocery store?

MORRIS: Hm? What?

JEAN: You were talking about how oranges were the most valuable thing!

MORRIS: Uhhh…

JEAN: That billionaires were panic buying them, so the prices went up?

MORRIS: Right!

JEAN: Are we stealing from a grocery store next?

MORRIS:
